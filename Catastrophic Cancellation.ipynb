    "When computers perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction etc. It does not perform them the way humans do. Instead they perform fixed-precision arithmetic using only 64 bits, i.e. in order to hold results they use finite number of decimal places, this means numbers get rounded to the nearest finite number. Not paying attention to the possible problems arising from this has real [consequences](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/).\n",

    "One of the problems seen when working with limited precision is known as Catastrophic Cancellation. In order to explain this concept I'll use *decimal* - a python package which offers arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n",

    "\n",

    "But the error didn't really matter when value we cared about was around $1$, the reason the [relative error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error#Formal_Definition) shot up was because the \"actual\" value became close to zero when we subtracted the close numbers. And **the closer you are to zero the more important these significant digits that we lost become.**\n",

    "Here its important to understand the relevance of relative error, an absolute error of $10^{-5}m$ can be neglected when measuring something like the height of a room, but the *same* absolute error in measuring the diameter of a human hair (typically 17 to 181 μm i.e. $10^{-6}m$) would mean that you're approximation is really wrong. \n",
