    "Computers perform fixed-precision arithmetic with a maximum of 64 bits of precision. This has real [consequences](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems seen when working with limited precision is known as Catastrophic Cancellation. It is basically the phenomenon of losing significant digits when computers perform subtraction of close numbers, it starts out when information is lost due to the **rounding off** that occurs, but the consequences are only apparent when we subtract. In order to showcase this concept I'll use *decimal* - a python package which offers arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point note that the rounding that we did didnt introduce any significant error - just $\\approx 10^{-5}$, which is expected considering that we are using only 5 significant digits.\n",
