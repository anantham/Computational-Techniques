    "When computers perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction etc. It does not perform them the way humans do. Instead they perform fixed-precision arithmetic using only 64 bits, i.e. in order to hold results they use finite number of decimal places, this means numbers get rounded to the nearest finite number. Not paying attention to the possible problems arising from this has real [consequences](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems seen when working with limited precision is known as Catastrophic Cancellation. In order to explain this concept I'll use *decimal* - a python package which offers arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point note that the rounding that we did didnt introduce any significant error - just $\\approx 10^{-5}$, which is expected considering that we are using only 5 significant digits.\n",

    "But the error didn't really matter when value we cared about was around $1$, the reason the [relative error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_error#Formal_Definition) shot up was because the \"actual\" value became close to zero when we subtracted the close numbers.
